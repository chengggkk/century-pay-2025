Century Pay 2025 is an **AI-powered Discord bot** that simplifies on-chain transactions and off-chain requests for users. It leverages Discord's **social features**, making it effortless for users to interact and engage with others.

Originally launched last year, [Century Pay](https://github.com/chengggkk/century-pay) enabled users to connect wallets, send ETH to Discord users, and execute transactions via AA wallets. Now, Century Pay 2025 takes it even furtherâ€”with AI-driven automation, users can simply describe their request, and the bot seamlessly executes the transaction, making the experience smoother than ever. ðŸš€

## Example Features

Century Pay 2025 offers several powerful features, including:

-   **ðŸ“‚ IPFS Uploads**: Users can simply _upload an image through Discord_, and the AI agent will automatically handle the IPFS deployment. This eliminates the need for users to set up an IPFS server or write deployment code, making the process effortless.
-   **ðŸŽ¨ NFT Transactions**: Century Pay 2025 simplifies NFT deployment, minting, and transfers directly within Discord. Users only need to provide basic NFT details (e.g., name, symbol, and metadata URL) to deploy an NFT effortlessly.
    With Discord integration, users can:
    -   Share a **"Mint"** button with others to let them mint NFTs easily.
    -   `@Tag` other users to seamlessly transfer NFTs within the chat.
-   **ðŸ”’ ZK Integration**: Users can now generate zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to interact with smart contracts seamlessly. Century Pay 2025 includes pre-built ZK circuits: Please checkout out [circuits](./circuits/README.md). It makes ZK applications more accessible and easy to use within familiar platforms like Discord.

## ZK Poseidon Deposit Idea

To address the issue where a user hasnâ€™t connected a wallet but someone else wants to send them ETH, we propose using a smart contract secured with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). This ensures that only the intended recipientâ€”who can generate the correct Poseidon hashâ€”can withdraw the ETH. Below is an example workflow.

![ZKP flow](./public/ZKP_flow.png)

We integrated the ZK Poseidon Deposit smart contract with AI bots. It makes the ZKP more accessible and easy to use without installing any `snarkjs` or `circom` locally and even without understanding the ZKP.

In the future, we plan to integrate more ZKP applications with AI bots to make the privacy and security features more accessible to users. For example,

-   Tornado Cash enables anonymous transactions.
-   Semaphore enables anonymous membership control.
-   MACI enables anonymous voting.
